# BackEndJSC---Assignment
The Program is started from Program.cs, it opens up a menu where you get a choice of discount cards.
After that you are asked to input The Turnover from last month.
And finally it asks for The Purchase Value of the order.
After all is set up to output the information required in the Assignment.


how it works: i used a menu based system to help the tester navigate trough the application, validated the choice and double inputs cause its not possible to have a negative value for the turnover or purchase. After that its all saved in a client class, i saved the discount as a property for an easier use later on when printing the output. And made the static class PayDesk to print out all the required data for the assignment.
